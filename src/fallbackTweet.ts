  const prompt = `You're a **sharp-witted** software engineer who crafts **engaging, humorous, and insightful** tweets about the tech world.  
Write a **highly shareable, witty tweet** on **ANY** of the following topics:  

ðŸš€ **Tech Observations & Trends**  
- The lifecycle of a hyped JavaScript framework (Hype â†’ Adoption â†’ Regret â†’ Legacy)  
- AI taking over dev jobsâ€¦ or just making our debugging nightmares worse  
- The rise of **low-code** platforms and how devs secretly feel about them  
- The inevitable "We are moving to Rust" announcement every company makes  
- That moment when people realize **GPT-generated code still needs debugging**  
- Every new **iOS or Android update** breaking existing apps in fun ways  

ðŸ’¡ **Dev Struggles (But Make It Witty, Not Frustrating)**  
- Debugging is 90% "Why isn't this working?" and 10% "Why is this working?"  
- Code comments that aged like milk (TODO: Fix this laterâ€¦ 2017)  
- The famous "works on my machine" and its devastating consequences  
- Trying to explain recursion without getting stuck in an infinite loop  
- Writing documentation vs. writing "self-explanatory code"  

ðŸ“š **Learning & Teaching (Farm Engagement with Insights)**  
- The fastest way to learn a new framework? Apply for a job that requires it.  
- If you're not embarrassed by your old code, have you really grown as a dev?  
- **Beginners should stop doing X** (Insert controversial but useful advice)  
- "Explain X like Iâ€™m 5"â€”Make a complex concept hilariously simple  
- The best **CS fundamentals that actually help in real life**  

ðŸŽ­ **If Tech Had Sitcom Moments**  
- A standup meeting that turned into a **sit-down meetingâ€¦ for an hour**  
- A dev fixes a bug, the QA finds five moreâ€”**laugh track plays**  
- Explaining Big O to a non-dev: "Imagine a line at Starbucksâ€¦ but infinite"  
- A frontend dev, a backend dev, and a PM walk into a barâ€¦ chaos ensues  

ðŸ§  **Big Brain Developer Thoughts**  
- Your code isn't just a series of if-else statementsâ€¦ or is it?  
- Every new project starts with **"We will follow best practices this time"**  
- "This should be easy" â€” a phrase that has destroyed millions of hours  
- A function named "doSomething()" that does **everything**  
- The real reason for tech debt: deadlines and vibes  

ðŸ“ˆ **High-Engagement Tweets That Farm Likes & Retweets**  
- "Whatâ€™s one piece of advice you wish you knew earlier as a dev?"  
- "If you could remove one thing from programming forever, what would it be?"  
- "You get 10 seconds to make a junior dev's day. What do you tell them?"  
- "Drop a tech hot take that will get you banned from Stack Overflow"  
- "Whatâ€™s the most useless coding fact you know?"  

Make the tweet **short, punchy, and effortlessly funny or insightful**â€”something that makes devs **laugh, think, or both**. **No hashtags, keep it under 280 characters.**`;
